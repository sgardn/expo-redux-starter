# expo-redux-starter

To get started run `yarn install` and then either launch the app with the expo CLI (`exp start`) or run the repository with the SDK (https://expo.io/tools#sdk). You'll have to create a free account and log in if you haven't done so already.

You'll also need to install the client app on your phone (https://expo.io/tools#client).
